       "[\"Optics and photonics are parts of our modern lives. We use these technologies almost every day. There is an abundance of optical sensors, communication and data storage devices that use light. While many advances have been made by using the laser to improve the performance of these devices, the full quantum properties of photons have not been harnessed. Most of today's photonics is still classical. This talk provides an overview of recent developments in quantum optics. It will explain the limitations that exist due to the quantum nature of light and the statistics of photons and also the opportunities we will have in the future to improve the quality of the information carried in a laserbeam. I will explain recent ideas and trends in technology that will make the quantum properties accessible and an important feature of future technologies.\",\n",
       " \"In the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, Pauli's well known theorem asserts that no self-adjoint operator exists that is conjugate to a semibounded or discrete Hamiltonian. The theorem distilled the idea that self-adjointness and conjugacy of a time operator for a semibounded or discrete Hamiltonian cannot be imposed simultaneously. Since quantum observables are postulated to be selfadjoint operators in the earlier days of quantum mechanics, the nonexistence of self-adjoint time operator has been interpreted to mean that time is not a dynamical observable but a mere parameter marking the evolution of a quantum system. However, it is likewise acknowledged that time acquires dynamical significance when time is subject to measurement; moreover, there is the time-energy uncertainty principle, a reasonable interpretation of which requires more than a parametric treatment of time. This opposing views on time in quantum mechanics precipitated to what is now known as the quantum time problem. Pauli's theorem has been so ingrained into the physicist's psyche that it stifled serious sustained research on the quantum dynamical aspect of time until quite recently. One advance in the past decade is the construction of a counter example to Pauli's theorem. This led to the formulation of the first quantum time of arrival theory in the interacting case. In this talk we will discuss the ramifications of the theory in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and its consequences in time of flight spectroscopy and its theoretical relevance to the latest experiment in attosecond helium ionization.\",\n",
       " 'Proteins are known to carry out their biological functions only when they are folded into specific three-dimensional shapes or conformations. How does the protein know what shape it must assume? We analytically investigate this problem by noting that a newly synthesized protein starts as an unfolded linear chain of amino acids. When the chain diffuses through a crowded cell and folds into a specific conformation, each amino acid in the chain interacts differentlywith the aqueous medium since it may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, positively or negatively charged, among other properties.',\n",
       " 'Using complex networks tools, the work provides analysis of how the news media have reflected the variety of frames used by interest and policy groups when discussing population policies in the Philippines. This study is different from existing linguistic networks approach to framing since an inductive method of automated text analysis is adapted, but guided by a set of frame labels. We take six existing (and competing) frame labels for the population issue (family planning, population control, population management, prolife, reproductive health, and responsible parenthood), each having been strategically crafted by interest groups, and analyze news texts to figure how each frame is represented in the media. The method of taking a central node or term and examining word associations by constructing semantic networks provide a manner of capturing linguistic information that is frame-relevant. This allows for a close examination of a small but vital part of a gargantuan word network structure (17,616 concepts with 4,061 unique ones) using frequency and co-occurrence weights, but without losing the terms that may appear only a few times.',\n",

Participants from about 30 countries have participated in the learning process using laboratory and hands-on activities. Regional follow-up activities have commenced, including translation of the manual into French andholding locally-organized workshops in French in Tunisia and Morocco. The French edition of the training manual has been completed and plans are underway for a Spanish translation.

       " 'Multi-extreme terahertz ESR developed at Kobe University will be presented. Multi-extreme terahertz ESR in Kobe covers the frequency region between 0.03 and 7 THz and the temperature region between 1.8 and 300 K. Multi-extreme conditions such as the high field and the high pressure can be combined with our system. High field up to 55 T can be applied using a pulsed magnet and a 300 kJ (10kV) capacitor bank. High pressure up to 1.4 GPa can be also applied together with the high field. Developments of two new detection methods will be also shown. One is a micro-cantilever ESR system using a torque method, which enables the ESR measurement of μm size single crystal. We have succeeded in making the measurement up to 315 GHz and the achieved sensitivity is about 1010 spins/G, which is much higher than the sensitivity of 1015 spins/G using the conventional transmissionmethod. Another method is a longitudinal ESR detection using a SQUID magnetometer recently. The potentials of new methods will be discussed. Secondly, as an application of multi-extreme terahertz ESR, ESR measurement of natural mineral dioptase (Cu₆Si₆O₁₈6H₂O), which has a unique S=1/2 antiferromagnetic spin network called the dioptase lattice, will be presented. In this system Cu²⁺ions form the helical antiferromagnetic chain along the c-axis and the chains are also antiferromagnetically coupled. The magnetic susceptibility shows a maximum around 50 K suggesting the low dimensional character of the system, and it shows an antiferromagnetic order below TN=15.5 K. EPR cannot be observed by the conventional X-band ESR because of its very broad linewidth, and the terahertz ESR is essential to observe EPR. Moreover, the measurement up to 1 THz is required to obtain the whole profile of AFMR at 4.2 K. The details of our measurement results and analyses will be discussed.',\n",
       " 'We describe a multi-functional system that projects three-dimensional (3D) light fields for experiments in neurophotonics and for multi-beam optical tweezers. Here, we use a single laser to project 3D light fields via holographic projection. When the laser is operated in femtosecond pulse mode, we show that the projected 3D light patterns have sufficient spatiotemporal photon density for multi-site two-photon excitation of biological fluorescent markers. We show that these light patterns can be used for photolysis of caged neurotransmitters for analyzing the functionality and connectivity of neuronal networks. When the same laser operates in continuous-wave mode, we can use the system for multi-beam optical tweezers to manipulate an array of particles simultaneously.',\n",
       " 'Quantitative estimates for the quality of care are obtained from a Penna model that incorporates medical care. Enhancements in health services and welfare increase the average lifespan by decreasing the effect of heritable diseases. Feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by fitting simulation results with the Philippine life expectancy data. We find that the relative increase in lifespan is proportional to the improvement in care. The Penna model estimates of life expectancy compare well with the UN projections for the Philippinepopulation.',\n",
       " 'Any traffic regulation scheme implemented on road systems has its limitations: it no longer functions well under certain traffic conditions. In this paper we present a phase diagram to demonstrate that in order to ensure free flow at U-turns with an on-ramp, the density of entering cars must have an upper limit. We show using spatiotemporal diagrams that the alternate density wave mechanism (between cars from the U-turn and the on-ramp) that is responsible for the dissolution of local congestion becomes insufficient above this limit creating larger traffic jams.',\n",

In this study, the GATE simulation toolkit has been utilized to investigate the dose distribution in prostate brachytherapy. Differently-spaced 125I seeds were simulated inside the Zubal voxelized medical torso phantom. The results on dose uniformity plots, and its corresponding dose volume histogram, showed that for volume implantations, the 8mm seed-separation distance appears to be the optimal separation in producing uniform dose distribution.',\n",
       " 'We explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons that are connected in a lattice network.

       " 'We establish statistically that human-generated number sequences can be made random by utilizing external stimuli such as (a) visual cues in the form of number boards and (b) auditory cues rendered by hearing the numbers dictated by other participants in the group. Visual cues or auditory cues alone make the distribution of digits uniform but deficits in doublets and excess of sequential pairs are still observed. These biases, however, are remedied by using both visual and auditory cues simultaneously. We hypothesize from these results that visual and auditory cues can increase concentration, which is essential in tasks that use the short-term memory of the brain like random number generation.',\n",
       " 'We observe an abrupt loss of SOC behavior in a multi-layer cascade where lower piles are driven by the higher ones. Starting from a simplesandpile with power-law distribution of avalanche sizes S that scales as S1:3, we recover realistic size distributions from the first and second sandpile layers, showing good correspondence with rainfall and landslide magnitude distributions, respectively. Criticality is lost in as early as the third sandpile layer, with average sizes showing linear relationships with the average waiting times. The SOC behavior is lost when driving forces (inter-sandpile cascades) dominate over local stress redistribution mechanisms (intrasandpile cascades), such that avalanche sizes distributions follow the trend of the waiting time up to a scaling factor.',\n",
       " 'Reaction-diffusion systems including their characteristic pattern formation, are ubiquitous in nature. For example, such dynamics are extensively used to explain the stripe and spot formation in animal skin. Here, we investigate the effect of varying the concentration distribution of the source term in a reaction-diffusion system. In particular, we look at the behavior of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) when driven by linear, sinusoidal, or sigmoidal sources. We also look at the effect of changing the initial concentration (IC) profile from random to Gaussian to“lattice-like” distributions. We report a rich class of patterns, from static to oscillatory, as we vary the IC profile and the source dynamics of CGLE. We observe that dynamic equilibrium in CGLE is a consequence of diffusion term overpowering the reaction component, and is dependent on the interplay of source dynamics and concentration profile. This work adds a new set of pattern classes to reaction-diffusion systems.',\n",

The first method uses Ray Transfer Matrices and scalar metrics to quantify the extent of the misalignment. The perturbed light path due to the misaligned component constitute the second method. An expansion of the light path to second order is provided. Similarities between the two methods are discussed.',\n",
       " 'Viral marketing campaigns in the social networking site, Twitter, have been conducted frequently in forms of games of chance, whose growth in publicity is in the control of players who need to pass a particular message to their friends. Previous findings however show striking observations of the referral marketing immediately dying down, which paralyzes a large part of the downstream network due to decrease or loss in player activity. This game, characterized by a cascade networkof players raises the possibility of competitive social restriction that causes the prevention of the self from passing the message on. We attempt to explain the observed phenomena by a simple model that mimics this propagation and investigate strategic gaming conditions that possibly affect the performance of the players. The model developed aims to create an initial groundwork for more accurate interpretations of this complex phenomena.',\n",
       " 'An Ising-like system was used to model a computer network through which malware is spreading. The rate of spread of infection was estimated by fitting the infection curves with a standard logistic model and an exponential model. Graphical analysis shows that the exponential decay model fit the infection curves better than the logisitic model. Trends in the residuals suggest that current mathematical models for epidemics are not consistent with the system.',\n",
       " 'Imperfect carrier agents carry incomplete information. However, as a swarm a complete set of information can be retained if the swarm only requires a cumulative availability. The retention of complete information set of length L maintains the operation of the swarm resulting to its robust dynamics. If any part of that information is lost (or becomes false), the whole swarm functionality breaks down. Examples include: a community loses its cultural identity when part of their culture is lost, a biological organism dies when one organs fail to function, or a virus fails to infect host cells when at least one of the genes are not delivered into the cell. Here, we investigate the possible retention of the whole size L by a swarm of N carrier agents even if each agent is imperfect. When applied to typical values of L and q, a critical swarm size of N* ~ 10 results.',\n",
       " 'Having common interests organizes people in groups. In this work, we introduce a parameter E which measures shared interest of users in movies in an online movie-rental service. The threshold value of E determines the stability of the network, i.e. high values of Eth can form a tightly clustered network robust to targeted removal of movies. Analyzing the time evolution of movie rental behavior shows that the rental frequency of movies is not linear and that when fitted with a power-law, shows a nearly constant scaling parameter of 1.5.',\n",
       " 'Understanding how a society communicates is important in understanding the society itself. We studied the distribution of lengths of utterances, the basic units of speech, in a medium having a maximum utterance length. We considered the messages of Twitter, a social network and microblogging platform, as utterances and derived its length distribution. The derived distribution has two characteristic peaks: one at 33 characters and another at 140 characters, the maximum message length. We showed that the second peak is due to folding of a natural message length distribution about the maximum message length.',\n",

       " 'We examine the spatial and temporal properties of the deviations caused by the presence of particles in the velocity and temperature fields of a fluid undergoing thermal convection. The root-mean-square of the deviations in both fluid fields are evaluated at uniform time intervals and varying configurations of the Rayleigh number Ra, and is characterized by a peak near tₙ = 10000 time steps. We also examine the long-term spatial extent of these deviations, and find that the main effect of the presence of particles in suspension is to slow down the fluid convection, as well as change its spatial characteristics. The results presented here may be of significance in delineating the effects of suspended particles on weather and ocean dynamics.',\n",
       " 'We propose a simple model based on non-overlapping power-law sequential adsorption of urban-related pattern formation. Lattice sites are randomly considered (uniform probability) one at a time for its sticking viability. The probability that a particle will occupy a nonoccupied lattice site is 1/Dα where D is the distance of that particle with respect to the nearest particle settled on the lattice and the exponent α controls the sticking dependency of the wandering particles with the once already stuck on the lattice. Once a particle is settled, it will no longer move. The model, capturing both qualitative and quantitative description of urban growth system, may also be generalized to represent dynamics of non-mobile systems that may be highly- or weakly-dependent on neighbors.',\n",
       " 'An oscillator made up of two identical masses with Hooke’s law interaction and time-fractional order damping term is studied. The general solution is obtained using the Laplace Transform method and a method previously used by Burov and Barkai for the single oscillator problem. Transitions between different behaviors are observed when the position versus time is plotted as the frequency varies. Three regimes for the frequency are found out. The first region depicted monotonous behavior. The next one is a non-monotonous region. The third one is an oscillatory decay which is akin to an under-damped motion.',\n",
       " 'In a transport system, it has been shown that having equal headway time T – the time between succeeding arriving vehicles – is crucial to minimize passenger waiting time in a station. However this condition is difficult, if not practical, to achieve; thus having equal headway time is unstable. In this work, we investigate the case when the headway time is randomly distributed over an interval [T-∆T, T+∆T) and how the optimum value of the average headway time is affected by the headway degree of uncertainty ∆T (headway instability), vehicle capacity and passenger arrival rate. We also find that the relative uncertainty ∆T/T does not significantly affect the optimum average headway time. Further, for small ∆T/T, the decreasing (or increasing)unoccupied passenger seats for ‹T› > ‹T›* (‹T› < ‹T›*) compensates the increasing (decreasing) number of accumulated passengers left at the station. However, for high ∆T/T ~ 1, this does not happen. This finding will help us identify possible best plans for transportation management.',\n",
       " 'Many real network systems are studied only up to a finite number of nodes. These systems are often derived from a sampling scheme and become a subset of a much larger network. Here we study the variation of sampling properties of such networks. In particular, we tested the sampled networks robustness to random and targeted attack. The damage done by each type of attack is compared between the sampled and true network. The results show that connection dependent sampling such as connected node sampling and targeted node sampling preserves the robustness of the true network. A node dependent sampling such as random node sampling cannot capture the true network properties especially for small values of sampled to true network size ratio p. Sampling a network does not always capture the exact property of the original network. We are also able to characterize the extent of damage a network suffers resulting to different connectivity states: fully connected, fragmented and isolated nodes network.',\n",

In this work, we investigate this evolution by constructing word networks for English poems from different eras. Parameters calculated from the constructed networks differentiate Augustan poems from poems of other eras. This agrees with the analysis of an expert on poetic eras where the Augustan period is isolated as the time for predicative poems and the other periods are mostly represented by adjectival poetry. We have shown then that word networks reflect the structure of written texts.',\n",

The traditional method of measuring rugosity is tedious and requires a scuba diver. A faster, noncontact method for estimating rugosity is by getting the percent shadow. The relative rugosities from shadow correctly show which row within a quadrat is more rugose, as verified visually by a marine scientist and by comparison with results of the chain intercept method. Further studies should consider color variations due to changes in bathymetry to account for large scale spatial relief.',\n",
       " 'Cells change their geometry during necessary processes like cell division and differentiation, among others. Although geometrical variations are prerequisites for these critical processes, it has been shown that cells become more susceptible to viral attacks during these stages. Additionally, it is also found that leukemia viruses induce cellpolarization before spreading to a neighboring cell. In this paper, a direct relation of changes in cell geometry to efficiency of viral transport is speculated. Passive viral transport inside a circular cell as a function of cell geometry, specifically its nuclear size, degree of polarization, and eccentricity is numerically investigated. While clear conclusions cannot be derived yet for an increased eccentricity, an increase in nuclear size and in the degree of polarization both result to the increased efficiency of viral infection. The results may substantiate why viruses take advantage of different cell geometries in invading a cell.',\n",

The second visualization rendered the color change as a translucent layer that can be superimposed on a white image or on the digitally-cleaned image. The resulting color change visualizations were consistent with the actual perceived color change and could offer valuable insights to a painting’s color changing process due to exposure.',\n",

These superimposed Bessel beams or SBB can be made available using a modified version of Durnin’s lens-annulus method. In this paper SBBs are stored in a photorefractive crystal at λ₁ = 543.5nm and reconstructed at λ₁ and λ₂ = 633nm. Retrieved beams at λ₁ were found to exhibit the same periodicity as the original beam while λ₂ reconstructions were found to have a modified period.

Results revealed that at this excitation wavelength, InAs showed a much stronger THz emission. This contradicts previous studies wherein InSb has been demonstrated to have a stronger THz emission. However, using a Si lens coupler, significant enhancement of the THz wave was observed from InSb semiconductor as compared to InAs. Significant increase in the THz emission was also seen from InSb under a magnetic field.

       " 'The radial distribution of the excitation energy absorbed in a sidepumped Ce:LiCAF crystal rod was measured experimentally andnumerically. The measurements seek to provide qualitative evaluationof the laser-pumping efficiency in a prismatic mirror design. By illuminating the Ce:LiCAF crystal by the fourth-harmonics of an Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm, we recorded the far-field images of its 290 nm fluorescence using a CCD camera. The relative intensities of the fluorescence patterns represent the ground-state depopulation due to pump laser absorption at each point in the crystal rod. Non-uniform spatial fluorescence pattern was recorded with one-side pumping, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform absorption observed during fourside illumination. The influence of linear absorption on the pump energy distribution was also studied. It was shown that nearly uniform energy distribution, and thereby better pumping efficiency, is possible with four-side excitation than one-side pumping in good agreement with the experimental results.',\n",

For each ‘noise strength history’ the Runge-Kutta method was used to generate trajectories corresponding to 200 to 500 realizations of the noise for the driven Duffing oscillator. The plot of variance versus time was obtained and analyzed. The results obtained for 200, 300, 400, and 500 realizations were in good agreement. It is observed that for both the constant noise strength and sinusoidal noise strength cases the variance exhibits a generally increasing trend but with an additional oscillatory fluctuation. However the nature of the oscillatory fluctuation is different for the two cases. For the constant noise strength case the amplitude of the oscillatory fluctuation is increasing; while for the case with sinusoidal noise strength the amplitude of the oscillatory fluctuation is modulated. The variance is generally larger for noise strength that oscillates with a frequency ω = 1.32 than for ω = 100 and ω = 0.01.',\n",

The shrinking steps, attributed to the shrinking ratio λ < 1, makes the random walk a bounded diffusion. Associated to the four possible step directions, the random walker is confined within a square of dimensions 2λ/(1 − λ) × 2λ/(1 −λ).

Discharge current was varied from 1mA to 3mA with 1mA increment at 30 minutes treatment time. It was found out that effective changes in composition occurred when current discharge is at least 2mA. The low energy beam irradiation at 1mA only caused the CC bond to break and produce CO₂ and CF. This manifests chemical scissions only since CO₂ are no longer bonded to the PTFE. At discharge current of at least 2mA, C-O bonds were observed. This means that the composition of the PTFE has changed due to theincorporation of oxygen to the polymer. The higher discharge current caused many bonds on the chain to break and effectively bond with oxygen ions.',\n",

Using a particular diffusing element, IR illumination resulted in higher speckle contrast and significant axial intensity variation compared to the case of red illumination. As a result, enhanced phase maps are retrieved under the IR illumination. This study shows that the speckle-based phase retrieval technique, with a suitable diffusing element, may be extended to non-optical wavelengths such as x-ray and deep ultraviolet wavelengths.',\n",

We show that a framework based on MME can accurately quantify the glucose rate production at low enzyme concentrations. In particular, the experimental deviation is just 2.2 ± 0.5% and 1.9 ± 0.8% when enzyme is at 0.0018 fpu/ml and 0.0033 fpu/ml, respectively.

       " 'High-precision embedded probe fluctuation measurements are now widely used for characterizing viscoelastic properties of biological samples. However, despite the simplicity of this approach, novel adaptations for molecular applications and cell deformation measurements are still lacking. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the unfolding of deformed molecules in mechanosensitive cells, triggers the onset of mechanotransduction by exposing cryptic sites that may bind to support a functional cascade. Therefore, we adapted a theoretical approach characterizing winding probabilities in stretched polymers for probing elastic properties. Winding probabilities characterize folding preference for molecules under tension. Thus, we modelled counting unfolding events in single fibrous biopolymers under tensile stretching based on approximating the observed probe fluctuation as originating from a damped harmonic oscillator with forcing. In addition, we derived an adapted Worm-like chain model expressing force-displacement relations using an expansion in strain, which extends its applicability to force ranges beyond thermal regimes. Here, the expansion index is characteristic of tensile stiffness. Also, surface interactions between a living cell and a deforming spherical probe has been modelled by incorporating an adapted Lenard-Jones potential as the source of force contact generation as a first approach. The surface interaction predicts a deviation from the simple Hertz-model deformation, enabling an approximation of adhesion force in-teraction, which in turn provides avenues for understanding trans-membrane forces triggering the onset of mechanosensing.',\n",
       " 'We have developed an agent-based computational model to unravel the complex mechanism of interaction between immune cells and cancer cells. Instead of the usual mono-formalism approach where entities are either all discrete or all continuous, we have taken a complex systems approach where the model is a hybrid of continuous fields and discrete agents. In the model, nutrients, growth factors and chemokines are continuous fields on a regular lattice whereas cancer cells and immune cells are discrete off-lattice autonomous mobile agents. Off-lattice modeling of cells allows the simulation of experimentally observed superdiffusive behavior of mammalian cells and cell mobility is not restricted by a lattice and a limited set of possible directions. In addition to that, unlike cellular automata model on square lattice which describes cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion through heuristic stochastic terms, an off-lattice model addresses the adhesion forces in a more realistic mechanical aspect. Our model explains the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells that lead to different morphological growth patterns of tumors in the presence and absence of immune cells. Simulation results from the model demonstrate tumor morphologies that are similar to those observed in the experiments.',\n",

Most sensitive to deforestation are ground temperatures over the Amazon Basin, which increase 3 to 4K per million km2 of tree cover lost with both biophysical and CO2 feedbacks. In addition, locally, it was found that biophysical feedbacks alone can have considerable impact on climate.

In particular, we subject a random geometric network, G(R, ρ), to varying sampling conditions such as type of sampling and fractional sample size, α. We test the true network and its samples to stochastic attack and measure how robustness is maintained in the samples. We correlate robustness to a cross-over point pc that marks the onset of fragmentation in a fully connected network. We also identify the critical fractional sample size αc as the point of optimal information retrieved about the robustness of the sub-network samples. The results show that by increasing the connection radius parameter R, robustness can be enhanced and critical fractional sample size can be reduced significantly. The reduction of the minimum fractional sample size needed for optimal information about the true network is an important finding of the study.

Fishers may cooperate (share reliable information) or defect and a corresponding payoff results for their action. We analyze how cooperation/competition evolves as we vary the net income threshold of fishers to search for a new fishing site ρs and the net income threshold of fishers to punish defectors ρp. The final state of the system at low income threshold for the case ρs equals ρp is a global cooperation of fishers in contrast to the global competition (defect) for the case of high income threshold.

       " 'We examined the segregation and aggregation of a bidisperse suspension of finite - sized particles under different strengths of the thermal forcing and different disparities in particle masses. We find that the strength of the thermal gradient is a major contributor to the suspension’s segregation and aggregation by increasing the long - term degree of segregation, as well as slowing down their aggregation. In addition, at low particle masses (below relative mass difference μ = 20), the deviations in the fluid’s flow fields induced by their presence in suspension do not have significant effects on the resulting dynamics of the particles, thus one-way coupling from the fluid to the particles is sufficient for such scenarios. We find that two - way coupling effects become important only at μ ≥ 20. The results may have significance in particle - laden flows, as well as simplifications in the associated models. ',\n",

Sampled frames from a video of a sago granular mound formed by adding grains at a rate of ≈ 1/2 Hz are processed to detect void distributions in time. A time series plot of the normalized standard deviation σ/μ of the void sizes is examined, revealing specific frames corresponding to spikes in the plot. These spikes are due to the occurrence of large voids, indicating pile instabilities that precede avalanche events. The method detects both large and small spikes in the time series, corresponding to large and small avalanche events, respectively. The sharp increase in σ/μ and its subsequent decay in an avalanche event provides a small window for intervention, which in this case is in the order of ≈ 2 s, the driving period of the pile. ',\n",

A local swarm is introduced by reducing the swarm neighborhood by a finite vector radius R. The global best of the local swarm is then determined from the particles within this neighborhood. We also introduced a random velocity to each particle at every iteration, preventing the swarms from settling prematurely at solutions. The randomness also makes the modified PSO useful for problems where uncertainty in the optimum parameter set or the number of possible parameter sets obtained are relevant. The variance in the solutions found by the PSO algorithm provide an estimate of the parameters’ best range',\n",

Allelomimesis, in our case, is defined to be the tendency of an agent to move to a location in its Von-Neumann neighborhood that is vacant and at the same time closest to the center of mass (xcm , ycm ) of agents of similar class present within its prescribed radius of influence r. We show that r drives the segregation process of the agents such that a large value of r returns a state that is ordered and least random. Moreover, r also influences the number and size s of clusters formed. The allelomimesis index, on the other hand, dictates the degree of compactness of the clusters formed in the system.',\n",

We introduce an analytic expression that approximates the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) vessel shape: a cylinder with Gaussian shape enlargement at the middle portion. Under conservation of mass and simplifications of the Navier-Stokes equation for Poiseuillean flow condition, we show that the relative pressure gradient across the wall of the enlarged area varies with enlargement volume. We also show that the dynamic pressure contribution play a vital role in the total pressure inside the vessel as determined by the average outgoing flow speed parameter 〈vo〉. By looking at the variation of the pressure on the vessel walls, the model might be able to locate regions in a real AVM vessel that are prone to rupture and bleeding.

Dual-illumination digital holographic interferometry is used to generate phase difference maps (PDMs) of a rough test object. Focus measure values of the PDMs along the axial direction (increment: 10λ = 6.33 μm) yield an inverted bell-shaped curve which, in turn, facilitates the characterization of the plane and region of fringe localization and, subsequently, the localization of the rough object. The technique can be extended to applications that require fully automated control of fringe visibility. ',\n",

Squares and rectangular structures were studied with lateral dimensions of 800nm, 400nm and 200nm. The rectangular structures had a fixed width of 100nm. It was seen that as the lateral dimensions of the structures became smaller, the compressive strain, relative to the unpatterned εSi, within these structures increased. Hence, these structures became more relaxed. Also, all structures were more relaxed at the edges compared to their centers. These relaxations were attributed to be caused by the formation of free surfaces during patterning of the nanostructures. ',\n",

The behavior of transition energies with temperature follows the Varshni equation for semiconductor bandgaps with an additional offset contributed by the confinement energies of the quantum wells. To reveal recombination efficiency for the wells, the electron-hole wavefunction overlap is computed, revealing that as well width is increased, the recombination efficiency consequently decreases.

The PAni samples were prepared with varying doping time, annealing time and compression pressure. It was found out that the THz conductivity follows theω5 -dependence which is the Mott-Davis form. The parameter S, which ranges from 0 to unity, is inversely proportional to doping state. This is consistent with the decrease of S with longer doping time. Also, there is an increase of S with longer annealing time. Lastly, the compression pressure varies directly with the THz conductivity that suggests a contribution of interparticle conduction.',\n",

       " 'High quality ZnO microcrystals were successfully grown by carbothermal reduction method. SEM images revealed that the grown crystals are tetrapod like structures which could be classified into different types depending on the number of legs and junctions. The grown ZnO microstructures exhibit ultrafast excitonic luminescence at ~380 nm with slow component (33 ps - 250 ps) and fast component (<5 ps - 52 ps). The increasing decay time is due to decreasing coherence volume of the exciton in the crystal. Coherence volume decreases in the presence of crystal defects such as dislocation and lattice mismatch on the junction of the tetrapod. Thus, the decay of free-excitonic luminescence of ZnO crystals could be improved into few picoseconds by synthesizing ZnO crystals with high quality. Suppresion of 437 cm-1 E2 mode peak of Raman spectra at the junction compared to the leg suggest that the leg has more crystal uniformity than at the junction.',\n",

       " 'AlGaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs) with internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) as high as 69% emitting at 247 nm at room temperature were realized by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. The extremely high IQEs were achieved upon examining the impact of the growth parameters such as source−supply sequence and growth temperature (Tg) on the QW quality. With the same emission wavelength (λ), QWs fabricated by continuous source−supply method have higher IQEs compared to QWs grown by modified migration enhanced epitaxy (MMEE) method due to its higher Tg, thus exhibiting superior crystalline quality with minimal point defects or impurities. Moreover, the alternating source-supply sequence of NH3 source in MMEE promotes Ga evaporation and consequently decreases Ga incorporation, thus obtaining QWs with shorter λ compared to QWs fabricated by the continuous method. Furthermore, regardless of the growth method, λ increases initially with IQE then decreases after reaching a maximum with longer λ. The increase is attributed to enhanced quantum confinement and carrier localization, whereas the decrease is due to lattice relaxation. ',\n",

Raman spectroscopy confirmed the difference in the lattice constant of the LTG:GaAs epilayer and the SI-GaAs substrate. Upon in-situ annealing at temperature of 550°C for 5 minutes, the lattice parameter of the LTG:GaAs approached the conventional GaAs value. Terahertz (THz)-time domain spectroscopy revealed that annealed LTG:GaAs emits higher THz signal than unannealed LTG:GaAs. The increase in the THz amplitude was attributed to the increase in the surface depletion field of annealed LTG:GaAs caused by Fermi level pinning. Annealed LTG:GaAs grown at Ts=310°C emitted the highest THz radiation.',\n",

The three oscillators differ in linearity strengths. The difference in position amplitudes as an effect of coupling is reduced as the degree of the time derivative is systematically decreased from 1.0 to 0.9. The decrease in order increases the size of the limit cycle of the least non-linear oscillator but decreases those of the other two oscillators. It also increases the frequency while decreasing the non-linearity of all three oscillators.',\n",

A rainfall anomaly index shows a potential seasonal reversal in the SWM rainfall in response to the El Niño Southern Oscillation. A drying trend in the SWM rainfall is also found in the recent decades over selected stations. The regional climate model used is able to capture the spatial distribution of SWM rainfall and direction of prevailing winds.

We used two regional climate models, RegCM3 and MM5, to simulate a 10-year period using two land-cover scenarios. The first scenario represents current land cover while the second scenario replaces this current land cover with broadleaf trees. Results from both models show that changing cropland areas to forests results in an increase in temperature. This warming is due mainly to increased sensible heat flux with the change in albedo being the dominant factor.',\n",

A fine mode (<0.1 μm) was observed after midnight, corresponding to the onset of the firework activity. The appearance of a coarser mode (>0.1 μm) at around 3am is attributed to high relative humidity values and low difference between ambient and dew point temperatures, both facilitating condensation and thus an increase in particulate radius.',\n",

In this study, two satellite-based rainfall products, CMORPH and TRMM, are compared with observation from eight ground stations in the Philippines and the gridded rainfall dataset, APHRODITE. Results show that TRMM data gives slightly better estimates than CMORPH but both, in general, do not correlate well with observations. Rainfall estimates improve during the months of August to December and during days with extreme precipitation. The performance of satellite-derived rainfall products seems to be dependent on both geographical location and the amount of rainfall estimated.',\n",

An Electrostatic Energy Analyzer (ESA) is used to sample the negative ion beams with energies that do not exceed 1keV. The corresponding ion currents of the beams are then calculated. Theoretical values of the sputtering yield and negative ion production probability are calculated per ion energy value and then compared to the ion current.

       " 'Changes in the composition of a low pressure O2/Ar microwave plasma for varying plasma parameters such as microwave power, sample bias, and O2/Ar gas flow rate ratio were determined using optical emission spectroscopy. Intensities of representative peaks for detected plasma species such as O(I) (777.89 nm), O2(I) (845.82 nm), Ar(I) (812.39 nm), and Ar(II) (914.56 nm) were related to the wettability of treated stainless steel surfaces. Results have shown that microwave power increased the wettability of the sample due to increased power for generation of more active species. Biasing also increased the number of these active species attracted and could react with the negatively-biased sample. Finally, O2 addition decreased the intensity of the plasma discharge, but enhanced the wettability of stainless steel at an optimum O2/Ar gas flow rate ratio of 1.67%.',\n",

The plasma jet contained in various dielectric tubes was generated at an input power of 600W and argon gas flow rates from 1 to 14 LPM. It was observed that 0 % power reflection can be attained at certain ranges of tuner stub settings. These ranges change with the gas flow rate and type of dielectric tube. The tuner stub settings where successful ignition of the plasma jet occured for various gas flow rates and dielectric tubes were also determined.

       " 'Core-shell GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs nanowires with different diameters grown on Si(111) were investigated using room temperature time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The carrier lifetime for both the GaAs core and AlGaAs shell were measured. Both shell and core exhibits a double decay rate and a faster decay rate is observed for the AlGaAs shell. The initial fast decay in the AlGaAs is attributed to carrier transfer from the shell to the core while the slower decay is attributed to recombination of carriers within the shell. The origin of the double decay rate for the core still needs further investigation. However, one mechanism involved is the recombination of carriers within the core. This is the first reported measurement of the carrier lifetime of the shell material for GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs core-shell nanowires.',\n",

Force curves are measured on the sample to investigate the adhesion of the ZnO rods onto the Si(111) wafer. By exposing the ZnO rods in a steam-rich environment and subsequent cooling, the adhesion force increases by 5 times. After the water treatment, the manipulation becomes dependent on the aspect ratio of the ZnO rods. High aspect ratio of ZnO rods are fixed while low aspect ratio rods are movable. The water treatment is efficient for imaging ZnO rods with low aspect ratio and radius up to 2.5 μm. ZnO rods with radius less than 1μm need not to undergo water treatment for manipulation.',\n",

The Brownian motion of a particle depends on particle size and the nature of its environment. This motion can be used to determine or discriminate fluids. Thus, the accuracy of measurements is significant. In this study, the D and MSD are calculated from micro-sphere trajectories obtained at 26.1 deg-C. Temperature measuring devices, particle detection techniques and correction factors for constrained Brownian motion were implemented to capture the particle's motion dynamics.

This issue is important in many real-world problems involving the flow of matter(e.g. blood flow, drainage system, river formations). In this study, we introduce a cellular automata (CA) model that would show how different barrier formations inhibit the flow of particles through it. We implemented basic rules on how the particles interact with the barriers and with other particles. We constructed the barrier based on three parameters: the barrier density, the tendency of the barriers to move from its initial position, and the tendency of the barriers to cluster. The results of this study show that the rate of which particles move out of the barriers, or the flux, decreases as the density of the barrier formation increases. We also observed that the flux of the system decreases when the tendency of the barriers to move increases. We obtained no significant result on how the flux of the system depends on the tendency of the barriers to cluster.',\n",
       " 'Epidemiological models have been used recently to explain the process of infection spread in a given population. Reduction of transmission probability as a method to prevent the spread of infection typically assumes that the network remains unchanged during its implementation. In this work, we investigate the extent of spread of infection in a static random geometric network with free boundary conditions for different transmission probabilities. The infection process is investigated after 106iterations upon the assumption of one-at-a-time contact per iteration. The behavior with varying network structure and transmission probability is examined. We find that a “breaking point” is dependent on the network structure that is a function of the average number of contact possibilities per node. Hence, the network structure besides simply reducing transmission rate must be considered if infection spread over the whole population is to be totally stopped.',\n",

The data generated from the program were compared to results of previous works. Results from ABMS showed similar behavior similar to that obtained in the approach using ordinary differential equations. It was observed that prevalence of malaria decreased the number of susceptible individuals. Eventually the number of infectious individuals decreased. These individuals recovered and acquired immunity. As a consequence, the disease did not stay in the population for a long time.',\n",

Electrodes produced with these parameters were anodized in 0.50M H2SO4 and 0.50M KOH at varying anodization voltages (1.5V, 2V,2.5V and 3V) and varying anodization times (1min, 2mins, 3 mins and 30 mins). Anodization results show than Ru is stable in H2SO4 at potentials below or equal to 1.5V and heavily corrodes at potentials higher. At 3V almost complete removal of Ru deposit was observed after just 3 mins. In KOH, Ru dissolves at 1.5V which means Ru is more stable in acidic than in alkaline environment. Moreover, the surface morphology of Ru anodized in H2SO4 is smooth as opposed to that in KOH which has increased porosity and presence of voids. Hence, although XRD confirmed the presence of RuO2 after anodization in both media, anodization in H2SO4is preferred due to heavy dissolution of Ru in KOH.',\n",

Constant and random values for stop time, loading and unloading capacities in each route were also considered. Results show that the stop time is an important factor in the total travel time for jeepneys in both routes. Increase in stop time increased the travel time at an average of 12.86% and 13.54% for the Kaliwa and Kanan routes respectively. The Kaliwa and Kanan routes resulted in longer travel time values with an average increase of 17.60% and 21.72% respectively when the loading and unloading capacities were included in the total travel time equation.',\n",

       " 'This research aims to develop gold nanoparticles drug-delivery system (DDS) for non-invasive imaging for future dynamic tracking radiation therapy and X-ray DDS. To achieve this, the uptake of gold nanoparticles into pancreas cancer cells was quantified. Gold nanoparticles intracellular uptake was investigated using pancreas cancer human cells PK-1 , PK-45H and Panc-1. Cellular uptake using different gold nanoparticles sizes was analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). It was found that 20 nm gold nanoparticles uptake is higher compared to other gold nanoparticles sizes. The dependence on incubation time and concentration was also investigated. Accumulation of gold nanoparticles can be increased further thru longer incubation and higher concentration. From these results, the optimum condition for the uptake of gold nanoparticles by pancreas cancer cells was determined. Initial study using modified gold nanoparticles in-vivo was also conducted. The findings of this study will help in the design and optimization of the nanoparticles uptake for therapeutic and diagnostic applications of X-ray Drug Delivery System.',\n",

This effect offers an experimental tool to generate highly directional photo-excited carriers which could assist in the investigation of \"direction-dependent phenomena\" in graphene-based nanostructures. The depolarization of hot photoluminescence is used to study relaxation processes in graphene, both free standing and grown on silicon carbide. This analysis is extended to include the effect of a magnetic field, thereby allowing one to obtain the momentum relaxation times of hot electrons.',\n",

Time resolved photo-luminescence spectra were obtained using a VUV streak camera system. Nd3+:LaF3 has VUV emission at 172 nm while Nd3+:LuLiF3 emission was at 178 nm and 182 nm. The temporal profile of these peaks was found to have a slow component, aside from the well-established fast component. The fast component cannot be observed in the case of excitation by other light sources. These results show that EUV-FEL is a powerful tool for surveying materials with VUV emission.',\n",

Numerical simulations have been conducted with a mesoscale model using two land cover maps for Metro Manila, representative of the urban cover of the city in the 1970s and at present time. Initial results show an increase of more than 50% in rainfall in some areas due to the urban expansion. A potential mechanism for this rainfall increase is the enhanced convection associated with the warmer urban surface combined with the high moisture during this rainfall event.',\n",

This research focuses on the modification of the mixing ratio based on the difference in precipitation between the satellite and model simulations. Two case studies were considered: 1) Typhoon Saola (August, 2012) and 2) Typhoon Washi (December, 2011). Changes were made based on TRMM and QMORPH data where available. Results show that assimilations helped improve the accuracy of the model, particularly for TRMM-based modifications while the model shows difficulty in QMORPH-based assimilation due to the hourly changing precipitation systems.',\n",

Betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, degree and radius have been analyzed. Classical music networks obtained high betweenness centrality and radius while Rock music networks obtained a high clustering coefficient. These network parameters give information on the structure of the network and of the song. For the comparison of music networks over time, no significant difference in the network properties for Rock and Pop music. However, the betweenness centrality and radius of Country music networks was observed to be higher through the years.',\n",

We utilized an existing dendritic network model based from a greedy algorithm that starts by positioning points at random locations inside a circular substrate. A network is created from these points by minimizing a distance cost function controlled by a param- eter bf (balancing factor) that balances the wiring cost and path length cost of connection. We use the Linfoot’s criteria to statistically validate the correlation between the networks formed by these two processes and show that they are structurally similar. Our results provide an insight that dendritic growth mechanisms may accurately model the recruitment process of an MLM enterprise.',\n",

These contests are usually targeted at a certain class of users. Thus, users selectively opt-in (self-selection), unlike in random sampling or filtering where the users are randomly selected or directly sought out. In this paper, we looked for evidence of self-selection using macroscopic properties of the contest entries time series. We found that users who joined the contest have a different tweeting behavior from a typical user, which can then be observed without looking at the individual behavior of each.',\n",
       " 'Oscillation phenomenon in the dynamics of network-marketing firms is empirically observed. Its origin is explored using a population-dynamic model of firm membership. Members, who are classified into two types distinguished by socio-economic status (SES), are driven by the search for profit. A perturbation expansion reveals that the fluctuations ⟨ξ2⟩of the fraction of the high-SES type diverges as ⟨ξ2⟩∼ |μ − μc|−1as μ → μ−c, where μ is the relative per capita rate of recruiting the high-SES type and μc is the critical value coinciding with a bifurcation of the population dynamics. Diverging fluctuations destabilize the evolution-arily stable state (ESS) of an evolutionary game between the types consequently generating oscillations in the number of members of the firm. Empirical data from publicly-listed network-marketing firms reveal Hurst exponents that are greater than 0.5, which confirm the presence of criticality as predicted by the model.',\n",
       " 'We studied the properties of a network formed from nodes that are randomly deployed over an L × L area. All nodes are broadcasting at a uniform transmission radius, βL.Connections are established when nodes are within their respective communication ranges. We found a critical value, βc, equivalent to the percolation threshold of the system, that marks a transition in network characteristics.For β < βc, the network exhibits Poisson properties that are also found in Erdos-Renyi networks, and is consistent with the random geometric network model, G(N, r), for small values of r.For βc < β < 1, the network exhibits the small-world propertyof high average clustering coefficient in conjunction with low average shortest path length. For β > 1, we obtained a regular network where each node is connected to all other nodes in the network. We also show a fitting function for the mean degree, 〈k〉, as a function of β which captures the quadratic dependence of 〈k〉for small β. We offer an explanation why such a transition occurs in the context of percolation and use the results for optimal communication operation in broadcasting systems.',\n",
       " 'Atmospheric aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei that affect the formation of cloud droplets, thus they influence cloud formation which in turn affect precipitation. In this study, the diurnal precipitation cycle of Metro Manila in a 4 km grid-spacing cloud-resolving configuration was simulated with and without aerosol feedback effects using a regional chemical transport model WRF-Chem. The diurnal precipitation cycle for the month of July (of 2009 to 2012), which is one of the wettest months of Metro Manila, showed late morning rain suppression and prolonged evening precipitation. Precipitation suppression was mainly due to fine particulate urban anthropogenic emission from the morning emissions. As the ground solar heating intensifies into the afternoon, coarse seasalt aerosols are carried by sea breeze inland and is ingested by existing clouds, which results in the stimulation of the conversion process of cloud droplets to raindrops.',\n",

Using the Box-Counting Method, we calculated the fractal dimensions of a synthetic (images of overlapping ellipses) and natural data set (images of green peas). A non-linear relation between the number of ellipses and the fractal dimension was found for all eccentricity values. Upon normalization with the area fraction, the best fit curve was found to be N−α where 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.57. A similar trend between the fractal dimension and number of objects was also observed for the natural data.',\n",

A high correlation in these prices shows that oil companies usually change prices at the same day. The extent of how a specific oil company follows the price change of another was measured by mutual information. Shell and Petron were determined to highly influence the amount of price change of other oil companies by calculating their transfer entropy in relation to the other companies. It was also seen that Caltex is usually the first company to change its diesel and unleaded prices by getting the differenced time series.',\n",
       " 'In addition to the inter-event time T measuring the stasis time between successive earthquake events, we define the inter-event occurrence radius Rto study the spatial relationship between earthquake events. The value of R between two earthquake events is a simple Euclidean distance between their epicenters.Statistics of R reveal two discernible peaks Rshort ≈ 11 km and Rlong ≈ 1200 km corresponding to the characteristic values of correlated and uncorrelated events.Setting a threshold Rshort < Rthres < Rlong, we separate successive events into two groups: Return times of successive events whose R ≤ Rthres are recorded as Tin, and those whose R>Rthresare recorded as Tout. We find significant differences in the statistics of Tinand Tout, suggesting non-uniformity in earthquake statistics. Finally, we find that an intermediate value R∗ ≈ 111 km best separates the correlated and uncorrelated events in the time series.',\n",

However, the impacts of utilizing FADs are not yet well understood. We created a mean-field model to assess the effects of utilizing FADs on stock biomass and boat’s catch under various fishing preference towards FADs. Our results indicate that using FADs can be beneficial, but when effort is excessive, it can exacerbate fishery collapse. A quota-based fishery system, where a catch quota drives fishing time, can produce a phase transition where catch and biomass levels abruptly shift to low levels without caution.',\n",
       " 'We formulate a time-dependent nonequilibrium Green’s function ap- proach to study the transport properties of many-body quantum systems containing time-varying components. We derive an expression for the time-dependent current, in terms of two-time nonequilibrium Green’s functions, that is numerically exact, i.e., the formula includes all terms in the Dyson series expansion. The first system we study is two-leads system where the interleads coupling is switched on dynamically. When the switch-on is abrupt, we find the transient current initially overshoots the expected steady-state value, oscillates, and then decays as a power-law to settle to a steady-state value. The power-law parameters depend on the values of the applied bias voltage, strength of the couplings, and the speed of the switch-on. The other system we study is a transistor-like system consisting of a linear chain with a time-varying gate potential acting on the channel. The system reacts to the dynamic gate potential with a relaxation time that depends on the strength of the couplings between sites in the system.',\n",

       " 'ZnO films were successfully fabricated through electrophoretic deposition. Six (6) samples were prepared with different applied voltages. Higher applied voltages resulted to higher mass of ZnO deposits and higher sensitivities at 26.5 oC. The fabricated samples were reversible and more sensitive at greater CO concentrations. Obtaining more mass of deposits and the exposure to higher CO concentration can lead to a better sensitivity because more ZnO particles and CO molecules can perform and contribute to gas sensing. SEM revealed that the most and least sensitive samples’ (6 and 1 respectively) deposits were porous. Sample 6 had higher gas response than sample 1 due to its smaller particle size and thicker layer of deposits. Porosity and the size reduction of ZnO particles can enhance its sensing properties due to an increase of surface to volume ratio which allows more particles to perform in bulk gas interaction.',\n",

       " 'We report on the azimuthal angle dependence of the terahertz (THz) emission from bulk GaAs, InAs and 1 μm thick GaAs thin film deposited on Si(100). All samples were studied in the reflection excitation geometry using a THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) setup. For the bulk GaAs and InAs samples, we have observed a two-fold azimuthal angle dependence. The results show that the relative contribution of the nonlinear optical rectification effect is higher in GaAs (14.3 %) than in InAs (9.65 %). We expect this since the second order nonlinear susceptibility of GaAs is higher than that of InAs. For the GaAs thin film, we have observed a single-cycle azimuthal angle dependence. In addition, the relative contribution for the GaAs thin film (28.9 %) doubled as compared to the bulk GaAs. We attribute this observation to twinning, which is highly probable in the film since GaAs and Si has a large lattice mismatch.',\n",

Truncated tetrahedrons, cut tetrahedrons, and octahedrons structures were formed at the surface of the oxidized samples while nanoarrows were grown along the edges. By increasing the thickness of the In source layer the diameter and length of the nanoarrows also increases. It was found out that increasing the thickness of the Au catalyst layer does not present any trend to the sizes of the grown nanoarrows.

By using the time-domain signals, simultaneous measurements of amplitude and phase enable the calculation of absorbance and the index of refraction. These give the dielectric constant and, finally, conductivity. The temperature range studied was from 80 K to 290 K. It was found out that the THz conductivity is described by the Mott-Davis model, a phonon-assisted hopping model. This is expressed by a power law. The power is found to be inversely dependent with temperature. There is a possibility of this being related to correlated barrier hopping. Lastly, the activation energies were calculated using Arrhenius equation. The activation energies decrease with increasing frequencies.',\n",

       " ' This paper reports the result of a preliminary study on the pre-conceptual understanding on measurement and uncertainty of physics students (n = 102) enrolled in an algebra – based physics at the University of the Philippines Los Banos. All the students included in this study have never taken any college level physics prior to the conduct of the study. Using the Physics Measurement Questionnaires (PMQ1), this study evaluates the pre- conceptual understanding of the students, based on point and interval paradigm, on the following areas of measurement: single analogue and digital measurement, reason for repeating measurement, and data set processing and on the nature of measurement. This study finds that students, who are entering their first physics course, have different view on the ideas of measurement with majority subscribing to the belief that measurement is a deterministic process rather than probabilistic. The result of the study can be helpful in developing curriculum intended for physics laboratory instruction.',\n",

       " 'The effects of varying the number of quantum wells on the photolumines- cence (PL) line-shape of GaAs-AlGaAs multiple quantum wells (MQW) is investigated. Samples having 20 pairs of GaAs-AlGaAs MQW were etched at different etch times to successively reduce the number of wells. PL measurements were performed and analyzed by comparing experimental data to the statistical model of free carrier recombination. The PL peak positions is observed to have insignificant variations. The PL broadening decrease is suggested to be caused by the decrease number of wells. Moreover, the surface roughness due to etching results in the rapid drop of the PL intensity. Small variation in the well width is observed from the narrowing of the line shape as the wells are etched.',\n",

Actual output power as measured using a power meter is observed to be relatively lower in comparison to the input power as defined by the user. It is also observed that % deviation from the input power decreases with increasing input power—deviation ranges from 65 % for small value of input power to 8.5 % at high input power. With these observations, plot of output power, obtained using a power meter, vs input power of a 1.5 kW magnetron is generated to provide the necessary calibration for the given magnetron. Calorimetric measurements also conducted to confirm the power meter measurements agree with the predicted values of the generated experimental trend line.

Interesting behavior in the intragrain and intergrain responses are observed at varying AC and DC field strengths. For AC susceptibility measurements, results show that the presence of the intragranular peak depends on the strength of the applied field. Increasing the induced AC magnetic field, the intergranular peak moves to lower temperatures and broadening is observed. A non vortex model used in YBCO and MgB2 is used to fit the imaginary component of the susceptibility. The model fit results show that the behavior in χ'' is due to the intergrain resistance occuring when grains start to couple. The morphology of the grains plays an important role in the study of AC magnetic susceptibility.\",\n",

It was observed that there was a marginal shift of PL peaks when the annealing temperature were increased, and that a broad new peak emerged at 520 nm at the 8000C annealing temperature. These findings were consistent with previous studies showing that a redistribution of defects and incomplete Zn interestitial migration are factors that affect the characteristics of the ZnO nanorods PL spectra. Furthermore, O vacancies might plays a role in the observed PL peaks in the visible region, and in the observed broadened PL spectra after annealing.',\n",

       " \"Bulk YBCO samples with various Mn2+ doping concentrations (x=0.01, 0.15, 0.17, 0.19, 0.21, and 0.30) were prepared. The behavior of the intragranular and intergranular responses in the fundamental complex susceptibility (χ'+iχ'') under varying low AC field amplitude in the range of 0.08mT to 0.13mT was investigated. The temperature dependence of the AC magnetic susceptibility shows that samples with higher doping concentration were highly influenced by the change of the AC magnetic field amplitude. Double peak in the χ'' and shoulder transition in χ’ were observed. These features disappear as the doping concentration increases. It was also found that the field-independent region at the onset of diamagnetic transition in χ' broadens. Relating this with the degree of granularity of the samples observed in the scanning electron microscope images, the decrease in grain size results to the longer transition width. This behavior is possibly associated with the suppressed diamagnetic shielding abilities in the grain periphery. Therefore, Mn2+ deteriorates the superconducting properties of the grains.\",\n",

       " 'A wide range of important phenomena in condensed matter, such as the molecular and lattice vibrations, free carrier dynamics and various electronic excitations, have their characteristic frequencies and energy ranges that are covered by the infrared (IR) radiation. Accordingly, the IR spectroscopy has been one of the most popular experimental techniques in various fields of basic science and industrial research. The most commonly-used IR source has been the thermal source, which utilizes the black-body radiation from a rod of SiC heated to about 1500K. Although such thermal sources are widely used in commercial IR spectrometers, they have a drawback of low brightness: it can deliver only a low intensity of IR radiation when a small region of the sample must be studied with a microscope. To overcome this, the synchrotron radiation (SR) has been utilized as a bright IR source. SR is emitted by a high energy electron beam passing through a magnetic field, and has a high brightness and low beam divergence. These characteristics make an ideal IR source for microscopy and other studies with a limited sample space, such as high pressure and high magnetic field studies. Using IR-SR, microscopy with a diffraction limited beam diameter on the sample, of the order of wavelength (~10 μm), has been made possible.

Thanks to those efforts, knowledge in spintronics has been materialized into the realization of ultra-high-density magnetic storage and development of integrated non-volatile memory. At present, scientists worldwide are about to start building the second framework in which spin information is input, processed, and output without the charge motion. To this end, I am, with my colleagues, studying the way to manipulate spins in magnetic materials with light. At the present stage, it is very important to pave the way toward establishing fundamental concepts of optical manipulation of spins. A key is the spin-orbit interaction, and, in order to understand this interaction better, we pursue experimentally (a) how fast we can manipulate ordered-spins and (b) to what extent the power of optical excitation can be reduced to manipulate ordered-spins, together with efforts to develop new materials systems to pursue (a) and (b). Other important subject is establishing fundamental concepts of devices for mutual conversion between light and spins. We study this with (c) circularly polarized light emitters/detectors and (d) spin-controlled optical waveguides. I will review those topics by showing recent experimental results obtained in my laboratory.',\n",
       " 'Cilia are protrusions present in most eukaryotic cells, with essential functions in motility and sensing. Development and maintenance of these microtubule-based organelles is crucially dependent on a specific transport process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). In the chemosensory cilia of C. elegans, two kinesin-2-family motors, heterotrimeric kinesin-II and homodimeric OSM-3-kinesin, act together in order to establish anterograde transport. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy we show that kinesin-II gradually undocks from IFT trains that are initially formed out of tens of both motors allowing the OSM-3-kinesin train to reach terminal velocity already at the middle segment. The precise mechanism of how IFT trains are relayed between the two types of motors is, however, unknown and its unraveling requires assessing the dynamics of individual motor proteins. To this end we employed single-particle tracking in combination with photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM). We are able to follow single motor proteins deep inside the living organism and observe rich motor dynamics, such as transitions between processive walks, back-stepping, pausing and diffusion. Building superresolution images from single molecule localizations allows us to resolve the ultrastructure of cilia, onto which we can map single-motor trajectories. Our findings are the outset for a single-molecule view on IFT.',\n",
       " 'Seen as a material, the interior of biological cells is a very unique kind of matter, chemically driven away from equilibrium by the internal energy-dissipating and force-generating machinery. Reconstituted active cytoskeletal networks, consisting of cross-linked filamentous actin driven by myosin motor proteins, have been shown to be a useful model system that resembles nonequilibrium situations in cells. Here we carried out microrheology study of this active reconstituted system. Being active driven, the fluctuation of the probe particle is orders of magnitude larger than that of thermal, which provides relevant information on the force generations and stress transmission which is profoundly influenced by the complex interaction with the surrounding matices. In prior study [1], the second moment of the athermal fluctuations has been investigated following the standard procedure established for the microrehology in homogeneous continuum in equilibrium whereGaussian fluctuations are expected. Here we investigate the full displacement distribution of the athermal fluctuations in active cytoskeletons which are found to be far from Gauss [2]. We develop a model to investigate the origin of this non-Gaussian behavior based on the truncated Lévy statistics [3], as a general consequence of the randomly distributed effectors whose impact spatially decays as $1/r^2$, such as the gravitational mass, electric charges, and force dipoles.',\n",
       " 'Intercellular signaling is an important physiological phenomenon involved in maintaining homeostasis in all tissues. In bone, intercellular communication via chemical signals like nitric oxide (NO) plays a critical role in the dynamic process of bone remodeling. It is believed that osteocytes are the mechanosensors in bone. If bones are mechanically loaded, the resulting shear stress caused by strain-derived interstitial fluid flow can activate them. Activated osteocytes produce signaling molecules like NO, which modulate the activity of the bone forming osteoblasts, and the bone resorbing osteoclasts, thereby orchestrating bone adaptation to mechanical loading. This single-cell level mechanosensing and intercellular signaling is essential for bone adaptation to mechanical loading. Since NO production is essential for loading-induced bone formation in vivo, the NO production in response to mechanical stimulation is a meaningful parameter for measuring bone cell activation. Several studies have shown that NO production is rapidly increased in response to mechanical stress in bone cells, including isolated osteocytes. How a mechanically-stimulated single osteocyte functions in a social context via intercellular communication, was studied by monitoring changes in intracellular NO production, using DAR-4M AM chromophore, in the surrounding osteocytes. A single mechanically-stimulated osteocyte activates its surrounding osteocytes via direct and/or indirect intercellular signaling. In single osteocytes, mechanical stimulation of both cell body and cell process results in upregulation of intracellular NO production, indicating that both cell body and cell process might play a role in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction in bone. Osteocytes with round-suspended morphology require lower force stimulation to show an increase in NO production, even though they are an order of magnitude more elastic compared to flat-adherent cells. Apparently, elastic osteocytes seem to require less mechanical forces in order to respond with increased NO production than stiffer cells. Bone cells release increased amounts of NO in relation to the rate of fluid shear stress as demonstrated by bone cells in a broad range of frequencies induced by vibration stress. This supports the notion that bone formation in vivo is stimulated by dynamic rather than static loads. This rate-dependent response occurs provided that the cells initially experience a stress-kick. The bone cell response to stress is enhanced by the addition of noise, i.e. the NO released by bone cells reaches a maximum at the application of an optimum noise-level by fluid shear stress. Since mechanical stimuli and NO production enhance the fracture resistance of bone, these data may facilitate the development of novel osteoporosis treatments.',\n",

       " 'Finding the optimal network structure for information processing remains a challenge in using any of the learning algorithms available. Here we study the optimum architectural scaling of artificial neural networks (ANN) for efficient online learning using parity-N tests. We examine the learning performances of different architectures of a network with four layers-input, entry, hidden, and output. We show that the network learns more accurately when the layer sizes decrease by an order of magnitude from the entry layer to the output layer. This scaling avoids the redundancy of information processing with extra nodes via information compression. The same architecture is seen in neural network for vision in the primate eye. While information compression is observed when the network optimizes the correctness of learning, information expansion is observed when the network optimizes both the speed and correctness simultaneously. Here the use of a hidden layer size that is twice the entry layer size counter-intuitively results to the most efficient learning of the network. The scaling property is similar to the human olfactory network architecture.',\n",

We find out that most of the particles at the top-most portion of the granular step collapses straightforwardly while those at the bottom contributed to the sideways runout. Our result is consistent with the previous theoretical and statistical analyses where runout distances are found to be governed by the extreme value distribution. Our results confirm that the nature of the runout base significantly affects the resulting dynamics of the flow. The flow is affected by the sideway motion of the particles coming from the bottom of the heap, and the lateral spread of the particlesare more apparent for a base with significantly high coefficient of restitution.',\n",

Random, edge length, and edge betweenness are considered in choosing which links to mutate from two-way to one-way. The results show that there is an optimal fraction of one-way edges that yields maximum reduction in cost of network construction and minimum increase in average trip distance. We find that mutating the edges with small betweenness is the best method, reducing the relative cost of network construction by 35% and increasing the relative shortest path distance by 43%.

In this work, we show that this shortening occurs even for a brief period of 3 years (September 2009-December 2012) using 229 million utterances from Twitter.

       " 'Remedial education is compulsory for students who have insufficient reading, writing and mathematical skills statutory for more advanced courses in the curriculum. Scholars argue that enrolling in remedial courses stigmatizes students and discourages them by compromising the continuity of their academic time line. Therefore, a careful and thorough investigation of the curriculum structure is necessary. This paper deals with the detection of crucial subjects in the curriculum using the network approach. From the list of courses offered in UP Diliman (BS Physics (P–BS), BS Applied Physics (AP–BS), BS Physics–MS–PhD (P-BSMSPhD) and BS Applied Physics–MS-PhD (AP-BSMSPhD)), we construct a float time network to detect node criticalities. P–BS has more crucial nodes than AP–BS. Criticalities desaturate across the merged undergraduate-graduate curricula (P-BSMSPhD and AP-BSMSPhD), this time rendering PhD dissertations critical. We also classify AP–BS curriculum as a combination of random and scale–free network.',\n",

The total fraction of infected individuals after very long iterations, Ω∞,is calculated to see the effect of the neighborhood and them spatial constraints. It is found out Ω∞ depends on the fraction of agents that belongs to the largest cluster in the system, <S>. Also, we found that consistent with percolation theory, there exists a critical density ρc wherein the whole population will be infected. At ρ ∼ ρc, it takes the longest time for the infection to spread and is explained to be due to the configuration of the formed connected clusters. As ρ approaches unity (maximum density), the rate of infection approaches a constant rate for the von Neumann neighborhood and linearly increases for Moore neighborhood implying a dependence of the spread to the average connection <k>each agent has.',\n",

Recursion relations for the first two moments were obtained and were compared to the exact solutions of Schutz and Trimper for the nElephant walk. Plots suggest that the moments in the transient stages for the walkers with memory lapse behave differently as compared to that of the walker with full memory. This is caused by the Markovian nature of the second step for the walker with memory lapse. However, the long time behavior of the second moment of the walker with memory lapse follow a power law behavior similar to that of the Elephant walk solution.',\n",

       " 'We present a logistic model of growth and diffusion of natural resource that incorporates a harvest term and is applied to investigating the effect of marine protected areas (MPAs). The form of the harvest term makes it possible to differentiate between abusive and non-abusive types of harvest methods. We numerically solve the equation on a 20 × 20 square lattice where each cell is subjected to growth, harvest and diffusion for every iteration. As that with the diffusion term, catastrophic harvest rates which are found for abusive types of harvest and catastrophic conditions are found to be similar to that without the diffusion term. The 10% MPA is found not enough to solve the catastrophic events that may happen except that if strictly implemented will “save” the local protected area from over harvest. The advantage of having MPAs is that the population will never be depleted and sustains a greater population for all magnitude of harvest compared to ones without MPAs. We expect that our model can be used to investigate ways and policies that balances conservation and sustainable support for livelihood.',\n",

In this study, the graphite target was placed inside a vacuum chamber pumped down to and maintained at a base pressure of ~ 10-2 mbar. The graphite target was ablated for 6 hours using a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser operating at a wavelength centered at 786 nm, pulse repetition rate of 80MHz and pulse duration of around 100 fs. The graphite plasma plume spectra showed a continuum from around 500 nm to 700 nm with emission peaks from C(I), C(II), C2, N(I) and N(II) species. Ablation was done in a low vacuum environment so that Nitrogen species are still observable in the plasma plume. It can be inferred from this spectrum that the plasma plume is dominated by neutral and lower-charged carbon particles which is typical for femtosecond ablation of graphite. Confirmation of presence of graphite-like structures was made byplacing silicon (111) substrate opposite the graphite target and checking its X-ray diffraction spectra.',\n",

The computational tool of choice, KMC simulation, is relatively cheap to implement, and is appropriate to use for longer and bigger time and length scales than can be accessed using molecular dynamics simulations. However, these advantages come with a caveat when KMC modeling is not done with particular attention to detail, when its input parameters are not consistent with ﬁrst-principles calculations as well as well-known experimental results, and more importantly, when all the surface processes are not accounted for – the lack of accuracy and exactness in the modeling may lead to questionable results and inaccurate predictions. These issues will be examined during the talk, along with additional technical challenges inherent in these kinds of studies, such as when an evolving surface system is dominated by extremely fast processes that eﬀectively bring the simulations to a standstill.',\n",

In this paper, a novel way of calibrating projector-camera pairs for artifact-free 3D reconstruction is presented by removing optical and digital nonlinearities such as vignetting effect and inherent gamma of both the projector and camera. Vignetting effect is least pronounced at small aperture sizes so the camera was set at an aperture size of F/22 to remove the vignetting effect.

A mode-locked femtosecond laser operating at 790 nm with 100 fs pulse duration and 80MHz repetition rate was used as an excitation source. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to determine the surface morphology and elemental composition of the deposited materials, respectively. SEM micrographs reveal hexagonal-rod-like grains on the surface of the film and microcracks are observed which can be result of low deposition temperature. EDX spectroscopy shows zinc and oxygen as the elemental composition of deposited film with 72.6 and 27.24 atomic %. This work demonstrates a technique for deposition of ZnO on Si (100) substrate using low power fs-laser as an excitation source at low deposition temperature.',\n",
       " 'The wettability property of Ti3SiC2 deposited on polycarbonate substrate was investigated using the contact angle measurement. Dinolite Digital Microscope was used to measure contact angles of static liquid drops onto the substrates. Six samples were prepared, the first three samples were subjected to reactive sputtering deposition (RSD) with different CH4:Ar ratios of 1:10, 2:10 and 3:10. The next three samples were subjected to nonreactive sputtering deposition (NSD) with different target potentials of -50V, -200V and -350V. Results showed the deposition of Ti3SiC2 to polycarbonate substrate makes the polycarbonate more hydrophilic. As the CH4:Ar ratio for RSD and target potential for NSD increases, the polycarbonate substrate become more hydrophilic.',\n",
       " 'Auxetic materials are materials that expand upon application of tensile load and become thinner when compressive load is applied; in other words, materials having a negative Poisson’s ratio. Auxetic materials have profound application in filtration because of its capability of expanding its pores to allow for easy backwashing and variable sizes for particles that would be filtered. In this experiment, 2 auxetic structures are examined, with each having made from different fabrication methods. For the double arrowhead structure, a mold out of polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) is made and a cast made of 100% silicone rubber is used. For the star honeycomb structure, 3D printed molds and room temperature vulcanized silicon rubber were used. Results show that both the structures exhibit auxetic characteristics only upon the application of axial stress. Both structures exhibited a reduced auxeticability, mainly because of the fabrication process. Both structures also exhibited excellent defouling properties since the pores of the structures opened up upon the application of tensile stress.',\n",

Mn-doping suppresses axial and radial growth of the pod-like structures due to the differences of Zn and Mn ionic radii and the preferred coordination of Mn in oxides. Mn-doping also leads to the slight increase of the inherent defect-related visible emission of ZnO. All Mn-doped ZnO, however, have maintained their hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure and intense UV emissions. Mn-doping is successfully achieved through a modified ACG method without a highly detrimental effect on the desired properties of ZnO.',\n",
       " 'The magnetic field orientation dependence of magnetoresistivity MR and activation energy U0 was studied. It is found that MR and U0 vary as a function of the magnetic field orientation which shows the anisotropic behavior of the film. The magnetic field applied perpendicular to c-axis gives shorter resistive transition width, lower MR, and higher activation energy. This suggests that the pinning ability of the film in the field perpendicular to the c-axis is stronger than that applied parallel. The presence of independently moving vortices along the superconducting planes in the parallel direction results to a weaker pinning force.',\n",

In particular, we calculate the time of arrival delay of an incident Gaussian wave-packet as it traverse a barrier region. It turns out that the arrival time delay is of exponential order and oscillatory. Also, the observed delay is not necessarily due to the above the barrier energy component of the incident wave-packet. We also provide some possible explanations for the different sign of the time of arrival delay.',\n",

       " 'In an open quantum walk, the internal state of a system undergoing a random walk changes with each step that it takes, with the dynamics being driven by the coupling between the system and the environment. Recent work has shown that such a system displays rich dynamical behavior. Currently, we are investigating the homogeneous open quantum walk on a line for a system with N internal degrees of freedom, which is described mathematically by a master equation with two jump operators, one of which is diagonalizable. In this work, we consider the homogeneous open quantum walk with N = 2 and examine its dynamics, as well as its steady-state behavior. We find that we are able to predict the dynamical and steady-state behavior of a system undergoing this type of open quantum walk simply by looking at the structure of the jump operators. This result not only simplifies the dynamical analysis of the system, but also helps in designing and controlling open quantum walks of this type for particular applications such as dissipative quantum state preparation and dissipative quantum computing.',\n",

The detected THz bandwidth extends up to 1 THz for the fiber laser system while it was 1.5 THz for the Ti:Sapphire laser system. This is attributed to the shorter pulse width of the Ti:sapphire laser. As a further demonstration, the THz transmission spectra of silicon (Si) and porous silicon (Psi) were also measured using the fiber laser-based THz-TTDS setup. The presence of pores in Psi resulted in a higher THz bandwidth of Psi (0.8 THz) than the THz bandwidth of bulk silicon (0.5 THz).

We analytically solve the output power of the beam that is incident to a nanocylinder and whose reflection is projected onto various modes. Among the modes that we try, the Gaussian mode and the tailored cylindrical mode produce power expression P’s, that can be related to the height and the radius. The Laguerre-gausian beams on the other hand, either do not show any expression that has a relation to the dimensions, or the factors containing these dimensions have negligible contributions. However, the P’s obtained for both Gaussian mode and the tailored cylindrical mode have inseparable factors that contain the information about the height and the radius. We therefore propose that a sequential projection of the Gaussian mode and the tailored mode to explicitly determine the height and the radius.',\n",

We use the oblique-angle deposition in coating a silicone grating to overcome this limitation. The grating is then tested in diffraction experiments while in one-directional stretching mode with a maximum strain of 2.7%. Based on the results, OAD at 80◦ with the grating lines and vapor flux aligned improves the diffraction performance of the grating as compared to non-OAD. Without applied strain, it was shown to increase the efficiency by 31%. When under strain, it was shown to decrease the efficiency loss and produce the largest diffraction angle variability, ∆θ = 4.01◦.

       " 'In the multiple-plane phase retrieval method, a diffusing element was used to enhance axial intensity variation for a non-stagnating iterative reconstruction of smooth object wavefronts. Traditional diffuser glass plates are tedious to fabricate and have fixed optical properties (i.e., are not wavelength-tunable). The aim of this work is to use a spatial light modulator (SLM) as an easily controllable diffusing element for phase retrieval. The polarization properties of the SLM enable independent access to the formation of scattered and specular beams allowing full control of their intensity ratio. A polarizer inserted between the SLM and a detector filters the polarization states and facilitates beam interference, thereby increasing speckle contrast. Using the polarization filtered setup, the contrast of the speckle patterns along the axis of beam propagation increased by 38% compared to the unfiltered case and yielded enhanced wavefront reconstructions. The technique is demonstrated using technical and biological samples and offers ease of implementation and wavelength tunability.',\n",

Measured contact angles showed a general decrease from 68° to about 50° implying an improvement in the hydrophilicity. Scanning electron micrographs revealed a network of highly branched fibers in circular patterns and that plasma-treated chitosan films have greater surface density.

It is experimentally well-known that a cargo move to the nucleus through an alternating intermittent cytoplasmic passive diffusion and mictrotubule-induced active motions. Using a stochastic differential equation that is proven to successfully approximate the dynamic switching between active and passive transport, we add a directed drift motion to our previous numerical model of cargo transport by diffusion. We find that while a combination of active and passive transport leads to higher probability of successful delivery, there is a weaker dependence of transport efficiency on the geometrical properties of the cell when compared to the case of pure diffusion.',\n",

       " 'We analyzed the network constructed from the recurrence of an avalanche in a 2D granular pile by comparing its properties to that of a network constructed from the recurrence of events in a random process (null model) [1]. We then infer causal relations in the occurrence of an avalanche when significant deviations from the acausal model is observed. We also examined the “extremal” recurrence (spatially far but close in time) of an avalanche. The distributions of the spatial distances and the in-degree node significantly deviate from the nulll model. From the latter, we infer that the occurrence of an event is highly dependent on the history of all the other events preceding it. Specifically, we found that there is a higher tendency for a suceeding void collapse to happen at the other side of the pile, away from the avalanche event it follows. Non-trivial network properties are also observed indicating the presence of causal structures in the underlying dynamics of void collapse.',\n",

To them belong robust and single shot technologies, model-based and resolution enhanced approaches, in-line and remote technologies. Optical metrology has shown to be a versatile tool for the solution of many measurement and inspection tasks. The main advantages of optical methods are the non-contact nature, the non-destructive and areal working principle, the fast response, flexible scalability, high sensitivity, resolution and accuracy. Consequently, optical principles are increasingly being considered in many areas where reliable data about the shape, the surface properties, the stress state and the strength of the object under test have to be measured. However, these advantages must be paid with some serious disadvantages that are mainly connected with the unpleasant properties of identification problems and the high sensitivity of optical methods against environmental influences.

       " 'Nature has many interesting things to offer - one of them is the fact that visible light (from near-UV to near-IR) contains an energy that is comparable to the electronic or vibrational energies of most of the naturally existing materials that we interact with in our day-to-day lives. Visible light can therefore interact directly with the electronic or vibronic system of a sample, and can extract rich information related to the intrinsic properties of the sample. This is probably one of the most important reasons why optical techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, have always been convenient tools for analyzing and imaging various materials. However, Raman microscopy in its conventional form is not suitable for analyzing and imaging nanomaterials due to two major reasons. First, the poor spatial resolution restricted by the diffraction limits of the probing light, makes it impossible to analyze materials smaller than about half of the wavelength. And second, due to the extremely small volume of nanomaterials, Raman scattering intensity is extremely weak for such samples. However, when conventional Raman microscopy is combined with the near-field techniques, it achieves new and exciting features as it goes beyond the conventional limits of optical microscopy, in terms of both the spatial resolution and scattering intensity. This can be done by utilizing the technique of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), which is based on plasmonic enhancement and confinement of light field near the apex of a sharp metallic nanotip for characterizing and imaging samples at nanoscale. This plasmonics-based technique allows us to have a spatial resolution down to about 10 nm in optical nanoimaging.',\n",

The structure of nearest neighbor geographical networks, particularly the distance between nearby schools, hint at two different mechanisms involved in the establishment of schools in the country. On one hand, we observe a passive mechanism that is driven by actual student demand, resulting in the spatial clustering of schools at urban centers. On the other hand, the government introduces efforts to also establish schools in far-flung areas, resulting in nearest-neighbor distributions that show comparable statistics with a null model of randomly-generated seed points in space. Interestingly, we find similar statistical features for different provinces and the capital region of the Philippines, suggesting that the proposed mechanisms are always present, albeit at varying degrees. To our knowledge, this is the first ever study of the kind in the Philippines; the implications may be useful for drafting policy measures to better handle the Philippine public school system.',\n",

Connections were made by linking avalanche events according to their spatial separation in the grid, either by being nearest or farthest among all other later events. The method has allowed us to observe new characteristic power law exponent of F = 2:1 for the in-degree distribution of farthest recurrences, in addition to the usual avalanche size distribution. This result is consistent with earlier observations suggesting that avalanches are inherently repulsive, i.e, a later event is more likely to happen at a farther distance from the previous. The behavior is invariant to all parameter variations introduced in the system, indicative of the SOC.',\n",

The adsorption of calcium on the wall of the nanotube resulted to the existence of an occupied d state which may interact with hydrogen molecules in the same way as transition metal decorations.',\n",

Magnetic field effects on the THz-TDS line shape were studied for both upward and downward magnetic field orientations using a 650 mT permanent magnet. A 180⁰ phase shift was observed in both the p-type and n-type InAs samples upon reversal of the magnetic field orientation. A higher degree of magnetic field-induced enhancement was observed in n-type InAs than in p-type InAs. Furthermore, the magnetic field-enhancement in p-type InAs is higher when the magnetic field orientation is upward while the enhancement in n-type InAs is higher when the magnetic field orientation is downward. These results were attributed to carrier drifts induced by the built-in surface electric field and external magnetic field.',\n",

The straight wire is divided into initially uniform segments and the Rashba SOC is turned on every alternating segment. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for both without and with Rashba SOC segments are analytically derived. From these obtained values, we numerically calculate the net polarization at the output. We find in our result that regardless of the initial spin orientation, the output polarization turns out to be spin-up polarized. The modulation effect of the segment length of the wire via a periodic Rashba SOC is manifested by the appearance of an energy gap whose width increases with larger Rashba coupling strength.

We gave N = 120 students in four different classes a related 10-item questionnaire at the start and at the end of each lab experiment. We found out that lab experiments resulted in an overall improvement in the students' test scores. However, a significant minority got lower scores after performing each experiment. We hope this work would help identify the strengths and weaknesses in physics laboratory classes and respond accordingly, by emphasizing key points and clarifying misunderstood concepts.\",\n",
       " 'The effect of STM on surface diffusion barrier of Antimony (Sb) dimers on Si (100) was computationally investigated using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC). The effect of STM tip is simulated using temperatures ranging from 400K to 450K in which STM-induced hopping is more prominent than thermally activated hopping. In this study, simulation results showed a decreasing trend in the surface diffusion barrier when ΔE between the tip and the site directly underneath it is increased. Additionally, it was observed that at lower temperature (400K) STM-tip induced hopping is more prominent than at higher temperature (500K); this is because at higher temperature, there exists a competition between STM-tip induced hopping and thermally-activated hopping of Sb dimers on Si(100). Lastly, it was found out that the scan rate of STM tip affects the behavior of Sb dimer hopping for both parallel and perpendicular to the Si dimer growth.',\n",
       " 'The application of an electric field and the ensuing spin precession due to internal magnetic fields in the semiconductor of a three-terminal (3T) device is investigated using the standard diffusion theory. Because the externally applied current is confined in one direction in such a device, the effective electric field is assumed to be significant. The dominant precession direction that dictates the spin dynamics is perpendicular to both the injected spins and the electric field. At large effective electric fields, the polarization in the semiconductor is completely drawn from the polarization of the ferromagnet and becomes well-distributed in the semiconductor.',\n",
       " 'We considered the problem of quantum state transfer through a tripartite linear chain of spins obeying the Heisenberg XY model, with Alice and Bob controlling the respective end. We studied the effect of changing the spin dimensionality of the channel on the behavior of fidelity through time. It turns out that the higher the spin of the channel, the earlier we achieve perfect or near perfect state transfer.',\n",
       " 'We derive an explicit expression for the velocity distribution evolution for two groups of colliding hard-core particles with unequal masses, initial temperatures, and group velocities for both discrete and continuous time case. We investigate the long time limit and obtain relations between the initial and equilibrium distributions in terms of mean values and variance.',\n",
       " 'The partonic cross section for the hadroproduction of muon pair was calculated. This process resulted from the collision of two hadrons (e.g. proton-proton) as the initial state. The three mediators considered in the study are the photon, Z0 boson, and the Higgs boson. The differential cross section was subjected to high energy limit and expressed in terms of Mandelstam variables. The effect of the three processes with the calculated differential cross section was also investigated.',\n",
       " 'We study the emergent thermodynamics associated with an arbitrary field quench in the Transverse Field Ising Model by calculating the fluctuations in the work done.

       " 'We consider a particle initially trapped inside a finite square well. The system experiences a linear distorting potential which creates an effective barrier for the particle to tunnel. We want to know the state of the particle just before the tunneling occurs. In this paper we provide a scheme of how to solve the problem using the Lie algebraic approach of Wei and Norman. We also show that the chosen representation yields a time evolution operator that is global in time. Numerical evolution of the particle’s state is also outlined.',\n",
       " 'We studied the production of a pair of Higgs boson decayed from a Randall-Sundrum (RS) graviton from a proton-proton collision with center of mass energy 13 TeV. The process was simulated using Pythia8 with FastJet3 framework to find the reaction products composed of hadronic jets. Quantities such as transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and invariant mass of the first two energetic jets for different values of the mass of the RS graviton were made into histograms using ROOT. Also, the relationship of the total cross section of the process with the RS Graviton coupling was observed.',\n",
       " 'We do resummation on the exponential integral function via N-level Borel summation. The resulting integrals are however divergent. Nevertheless, good approximation can still be extracted from these divergent integrals by truncating the integration limit up to some cut-off point. Our method of “superasymptotic integration” is justified by the small relative error obtained by the resummation.',\n",
       " 'We construct a table-top ripple tank set-up and an accessory wave maker moving vertically across the air-water interface to form progressive capillary surface waves. We employ the Diffusing Light Imaging (DLI) technique to obtain the topography of propagating surface waves and to acquire height values for the monitored 2D particle trajectories (or 2D Particle Tracking velocimetry achieved using nonlinear image segmentation via histogram back-projection) to provide an appropriate 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3D PTV) profile. We visualize the motion of a floater particle on the surface of propagating waves via 3D reconstruction of the surface topography with the particle floating on the waves and assign appropriate velocity values for the particle per frame of the single-camera video recordings to describe the trajectory of the particle.',\n",
       " 'Effects of the spatial filter used in the reconstruction of off-axis digital holograms are investigated. Two kinds of Gaussian filters, multiplicative and cut-off filters, were explored and compared with an ideal band-pass filter of similar dimensions in the reconstruction of digital holograms through the use of the angular spectrum method. The multiplicative Gaussian filter multiplies a Gaussian function centered at the desired peak in the Fourier domain and the Gaussian cut-off filter removes signals greater than the corresponding value of a Gaussian function. It was shown that compared to using the ideal band-pass filter, the Gaussian multiplicative filter results to less artifacts and that the Gaussian cut-off filter results to better contrast in the reconstructed image.',\n",
       " 'A technique for enhanced imaging of objects embedded in a diffusive medium using adhesive tapes is demonstrated experimentally and confirmed numerically. A wave propagation-based model was used to simulate how adding an adhesive tape on a diffuser plate improves the visibility of the objects hidden behind the diffuser as observed experimentally. The application of adhesive tape was modeled as a smoothened version of the diffuser and was observed to increase the visibility of the hidden object.',\n",
       " \"We investigate the terahertz (THz) mechanism in GaAs films deposited on Si substrates (GaAs/Si). THz radiation is observed from femtosecond laser-excited GaAs/Si in the reflection geometry. In particular, SI-GaAs/Si exhibits the strongest emission compared to the other GaAs-based samples and comparable to bulk p-InAs which is the currently-accepted strongest THz emitter. The GaAs/Si films have no significant azimuthal angle dependence of THz signal amplitude. Pump excitation power experiments show that SI-GaAs/Si has a higher saturation value than p-InAs due to the laser's deeper penetration depth in GaAs as compared to that of p-InAs. In addition, the type of doping could greatly affect the THz emission properties of the GaAs/Si film. This enhancement in THz radiation in GaAs/Si could be attributed to surge current by the acceleration of photo-generated carriers in the surface field and not to nonlinear optical rectification effect.\",\n",

Lett. 2011]. In this present work, the method is extended to the correction of multiple vortices. Furthermore, the effects of initial angle are investigated in the design of correction filters resulting in the efficient removal of the vortices. The effectiveness of the technique for the removal of two vortices is demonstrated numerically and experimentally.',\n",

       " 'The effects of annealing temperature on the changes in the composition of metal-oxide phases present in copper oxide (CuxO) thin films were investigated. The CuxO thin films were synthesized on glass substrates through spray pyrolysis and subsequent thermal annealing. The surface morphology of the thin films was seen to be generally rough and that the thin films approximately have the same thicknesses. The thin films were shown to crystallize in the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and cupric oxide (CuO) phases, with the diffraction peak intensities of each oxide phase varying with temperature. The ratio of Cu2O to CuO has been shown to decrease with annealing temperature as shown through the analysis of the UV-vis transmission spectra of the thin films. This implies that Cu2O transforms to CuO as the annealing temperature is increased.',\n",
       " 'This study aims at investigating the effect of KCl on the stability of Bi-2212 colloidal suspensions and on the resulting films fabricated via electrophoretic deposition. Colloidal suspensions of 0.0033 g of Bi-2212 powder with 10 mL ethanol plus 2 drops (~0.05 mL) of KCl solution in varying concentrations were tested for their stability. The colloidal suspension with 5.21 wt% was found to be optimum. This and the standard colloidal suspension were used in fabrication of Bi-2212 films. The analysis of the films showed that using the optimum colloidal suspension in film fabrication results to better quality film. The film had smoother film surface, high c-axis orientation, and higher Tc-onset of 84.73 K.',\n",
       " 'ZnO nanostructures were successfully fabricated on seeded unpolished Si(100) substrate using hydrothermal growth method without the use of any stabilizing agent in the seed layer precursor solution. The size of the seeds could be controlled by varying the number of depositions, and the presence of the seed layer was found to influence the formation of the ZnO structures such that it restricted their growth in the nano-regime. Moreover, the topography of the substrate surface resulted in clustered morphology and nonuniform orientation of the grown nanostructures.',\n",
       " 'A capacitive humidity-sensing device was created by coating both sides of etched double-sided PCB with aluminum. The device was calibrated by comparing the readings of capacitance of the non-aged device with that of the relative humidity sensor of the Vernier LabQuest2. It was found that there is a linear relationship between the capacitance and relative humidity given by the equation C=1.418RH+29.139 where C is the capacitance and RH is the relative humidity. As the device is aged, it was found that it no longer retained the linear relationship between the capacitance and relative humidity The response of the capacitance was less due to the presence of dust that inhibited the adsorption and capillary condensation of water.',\n",

SEM micrographs show micro-rods and (Cu and Ca-rich) precipitates formed in the surface of the films which suggests phase decomposition. XRD shows a mixture of Bi-2212 and 2201 phases with increasing Bi-2201 with In content. Highest mobility was obtained for x=0.20 film which has least precipitates and smoother morphology. The most conducting samples were measure for films with high number of Cu-rich precipitates.',\n",
       " 'Alcohol vapour based on nanoporous silicon was fabricated from 1.00 cm 1.75 cm p+ type silicon (100) in HF ethanoic solution via electrochemical etching. The surface morphology of the fabricated nanoporous silicon was characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). The structure of this sensor consists of porous silicon layer and silver electrode which is deposited on the surface of sensor. The sensing ability of porous silicon towards organic vapour was studied. The sensitivity of the sensor was determined as the ratio of the resistivity of structures in the presence of investigated gas to that in air. The resistance of porous silicon increased in the presence of alcohol vapour. It is found that the fabricated sensor can detect different concentration of alcohol vapour from 250 ppm to 1000 ppm.',\n",

Samples with finger patterns of Schottky-Ohmic pair, Schottky-Schottky pair, and Ohmic-Ohmic pair contact had their I-V characteristics measured. I-V characteristics were also measured after annealing the 3 samples at 460 C for 30 seconds. The Schottky barrier heights and series resistances were computed. It was observed that the electrical properties of the Schottky and Ohmic contacts used have certain effects on the Schottky-Ohmic pair.',\n",

Analysis of the Ag-TiO2 substrates showed spot to spot variation of the Raman intensities which can be attributed to the presence of hot spots on the surface. The highest Raman intensity was obtained from the substrate with 5 minutes deposition of silver. This substrate was then exposed to methylene blue and the resulting Raman spectra showed characteristic peaks of the dye. The fabricated Ag-TiO2 substrates have the potential of being SERS active substrates.',\n",
       " 'GaAs films on Si substrates were grown via Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The effect of pre-growth heat treatment of the Si substrate on the grown GaAs layer was investigated. Photoluminescence (PL) at T = 11K shows that the GaAs/Si band edge emission was redshifted by 23 meV as compared to as-grown GaAs indicating that the films are strained. The PL intensity of the GaAs/Si sample substrate treated at 720°C showed a remarkably higher PL intensity compared to the sample substrate treated at 610°C, indicating that heat treatment at higher temperature yields a GaAs thin film with better optical qualities.',\n",

Different viscosities of PDMS were used and its effect on the electrochemical response, surface area and specific capacitance of the electrodes were studied and correlated to surface morphology. Electrochemical performance was evaluated by studying the redox response of each CPE towards K4[Fe(CN)6], p-benzoquinone, and ascorbic acid employing Cyclic Voltammetry. In general, the MWCNT-based electrode showed good chemical reversibility, while electrochemical reversibility study showed hyperNernstian response for all electrodes.',\n",

The films were grown at varying temperature of 300-600 ºC and were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy to reveal the morphological and structural properties, respectively. The Raman spectra of films grown at elevated temperature showed a preferential band (G band) which is attributed to the sp2 bond of graphite. At 600°C is seen to be the sufficient temperature to develop the structural component of graphite. SEM images showed a flake-like structures and randomly sized particles. As the deposition temperature increases the particles also increase in size about micrometer. However, a further increase in temperature showed evidence of melting and clustering of particles.',\n",
